Tutorial Objectives.
To examine algorithms for accessing 1D arrays of reference variables and 2D arrays
Tutorial Activities
 1. The class Product is described below. Write a code segment for an array called
 productCatalogue to reference 10 products, read in product data, then display it
 and then find the product number(s) of products costing less than $20

 2. How many elements does the array int x[][] = new int[4][5] contain?
 3. Design a program to read integers into an integer array of size [3][3]. Treat the
 array as a 3 * 3 image. For example, it may contain the image:
 123
 456
 789
 Your program should then copy the array into a new array such that the image is
 mirrored. For example, the above image would become:
 321
 654
 987
 This new image would then be printed out.
 4. Now modify your algorithm to rotate the original image 180 degrees.
 123 becomes 987
 456 654
 789 321
5. Design a program that reads integers into an array of size[4][4], and then
 calculates if the smallest row total equals the smallest column total.
